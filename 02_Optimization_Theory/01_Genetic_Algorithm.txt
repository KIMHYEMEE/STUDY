Genetic algorithms are a biologically inspired stochastic metaheuristic for combinatorial search and optimization

# Terms in GA
- Chromosome
	Sequence of locus and allele
- Locus
	? Spaces filled by the Allele
- Allele
	? Values for locus
- fitness
	level of optimization
	
# Basis of model
	1. a problem to solve
	2. a fitness function
		- What makes a given solution 'good'?
	3. a way to represent solutions as 'DNA'
	

# Process of GA
	1. Create a population of random 'chromosomes'(solutions)
	2. Score each chromosome in the population for 'fitness'
	3. Create a new generation through 'mutation' and 'crossover'
	4. Repeat until done
	5. Emit the fittest chromosome as the solution


# Binalry encoding
	[1,0,1,1,0] means the chromosome use A,C,D.
	
	
#Selection

	1. Proportionate selection
	: Select the genes through the size of the impact

	2. Tournament selection
	: using part of population with the highest score

	
#Crossover

	1. Single-point crossover
	: For each chromosome, get only one part(sequence)
	
	2. Uniform crossover
	: if you use chromosome A and B, then you get new chromosome [A,B,A,B,...]
	  chromosome reach to the optimization point much faster with fewer iteration

	  
#Mutation
: Get new chromosome except the exited population

	1. Point mutation
	: Randomly choose one point to change

	
# Measurement of preformance
	- Solution fitness
	- Clock time to converge
	- Iterations to converge
	- Number of solutions expored
	- Inheritability
	
	
# Define fitness function(18:00)
When there are many requirements, it is hard to define fitness function because of many considerations
